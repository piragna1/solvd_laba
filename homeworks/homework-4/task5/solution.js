/*### Task 5: Object Observation*/
/**
 * Implement a function called observeObject that takes an object and a callback function as arguments. The function should return a 
    proxy object that wraps the original object and invokes the callback function whenever any property of the object is accessed or 
    modified.
 */
/**
 * Use the observeObject function to create a proxy for the person object from Task 1. The callback function should log the 
    property name and the action (get or set) performed on the object.
