/**### **Task 4: Advanced Property Descriptors**

Implement a function called createImmutableObject that takes an object as an argument and returns a new object with all its properties made read-only and non-writable using property descriptors. The function should handle nested objects and arrays recursively.

Use the createImmutableObject function to create an immutable version of the person object from Task 1. */
