Part 1: Data Structure Implementations
Stack: Implement a class for a stack data structure. Include methods for push, pop, and peek.
Queue: Implement a class for a queue data structure. Include methods for enqueue, dequeue, and peek.
Binary Tree: Implement a class for a binary tree data structure. Include methods for inserting nodes, searching for a node, and traversing the tree (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order).
Graph: Implement a class for a graph data structure. Include methods for adding vertices and edges, performing depth-first search (DFS), and breadth-first search (BFS).
Linked List: Implement a class for a singly linked list data structure. Include methods for inserting nodes, deleting nodes, and searching for a node.
