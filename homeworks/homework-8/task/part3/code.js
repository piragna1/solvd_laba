Part 3: Demonstration

- Create a Scenario: Design a scenario where 
        users browse books, 
        add them to their carts, 
        and place orders. 
    Simulate interactions between users, carts, and orders.

- Interaction: Demonstrate how objects of different classes interact with each other. For example, a user 
 interacts with a cart, and a cart interacts with orders.

- Polymorphism: Utilize polymorphism by treating different types of books (e.g., fiction, non-fiction) uniformly 
 when users add them to the cart.
