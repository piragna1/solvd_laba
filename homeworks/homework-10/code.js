### **Part 3: Building a Hash Table**

1. **Hash Table Class**: Create a JavaScript class for a hash table that uses your custom hash function. 
  Include methods for inserting key-value pairs, retrieving values by key, and deleting key-value pairs.

2. **Testing**: Create test cases to ensure that your hash table and custom hash function work correctly. 
  Test scenarios should include inserting, retrieving, and deleting values, as well as handling collisions 
  gracefully.

*/
/*

  1. Documentation
    Custom hash function: Receives as arugments the string that represents the key of the pair and a number that
      represents the current length of the collection that is storing the pairs.
    For generating a hash, it:
      - Takes a string and calculates the total of summing every character's charcode based on Unicode.
      - After calculating the sum, another calculation is executed, in which: 
        + the total sum is multiplicated by 2 different constant prime numbers,
        + the modulus of the collection's length is obtained from the previous multiplication calculation.
    Hash Table: It has an array that represents the table in which all pairs will be stored while tracking the size
    (amount of elements held) and it implements various methods for handling the different process that are commonly
    executed in the process of interacting with hash tables, such as:
      - inserting key-value pairs,
      - retrieving values,
      - search if some value exists,
      - remove pairs,
      - hashing the keys receipt,
      - checking and handling the load factor of the table,
      - handling collision utilizing the separate-chaining technique with linked lists
  
  2. Analysis
    Performance analysis:
      Method:
        + constructor
          Time complexity: O(n) being n the capacity indicated.
          Space complexity: O(n) being n the capacity of the table.
          Tradeoffs:
            - There is an argument accepted for assigning an initial capacity, which can lead to have unused slots.
            - There is no argument for setting the accepted load factor before resize and rehashing table and elements.
            This will reduce flexibility because it is hardcoded for resizing (and rehashing) when load factor reaches
            the value of 0.75.
        +hash: Utilizes  a custom function for generating a hash given an input string and the length of the table.
          Time complexity: O(n) being n the length of the key.
          Space complexity: O(1) since the amount of space used keeps constant independenlty of the length of the input.
          Tradeoffs: It is simple to read an understand the mechanism for generating a new hash for a given key but 
          it is relatively easy to reach the threshold of the load factor due to the lack of uniformity when inserting 
          new values also, because of the use of the modulus based on the current length of the table.
        + insert: Inserts a new key-value pair into the hash table mapping it with the calculated hash utilizing separate-
        chaining tecnhnique for avoiding collisions and using resize and rehashing techniques for maintaining a non-clustered
        informational structure.
        Time complexity: 
           - Average case: O(1) since it is straightforward the process of inserting a new value even if there are collisions.
           - Worst case: O(n) being `n` the amount of existing pairs in the table. This happens when load factor triggers
           the resize and rehashing functions and every existing element (n elements) should be rehashed and inserted into a 
           new collection.
        Space complexity: 
          -Average case: O(n) In this case an insertion directly to the current table will be executed. So, n being the amount
          of exiting elements, the algorithm  need the computer to store n elements in table. Hence O(n) is the space complexity.
          -Worst case: O(n) In the worst case, rehashing would be executed. In such situation, the algorithm stil needs a
          constant amount of collections (a copy, the new and the old table) proportional to the amount of elements,
          `current table`O(n)+`copyOfTable`O(n)+`newTabe`O(2n) = O(3n) -> dropping constants: O(n)
        Tradeoffs:
          - Some of the disadvantages emerge due to the fact ot using the separate-chaining collision handling technique. Commonly,
          it will use some extra space and lead to unused slots inside the table. In addition, performance of cache type operations
          will be reduced because the slots of the collection can be not singly valued.
        + retrieve: This methods returns the object in the table associated with the key or false otherwise.
        Time complexity: O(n) being n the total amount of key-value pairs stored and assuming that the one it looks for is the last
        readed.
        Space complexity: O(1) since no matter how it goes with the process of searching an element, the same amount of space will be
        required.
        Tradeoffs:
          - Due to the possibility of the existence of a separate chain, the time complexity of this approach will be increased from O(1)
          to O(n).
        + display: Displays the current state of the table
        Time complexity: O(n) being n the amount of elements stored in the table.
        Space complexity: O(1) since there is no need for extra space
        Tradeoffs:
          - It shows data inside every separate chain, but not all
          - It does not display the information individually per every element
        +remove: removes an element from the table.
        Time complexity: O(n) considering the worst case, in which the element is 
        found last or does not exist, being necessary to traverse the whole structure.
        Space complexity: O(1) since the amount of extra space required does not increment depending of the input size.
        Tradeoffs:
          - Similar to search method, and considering that separate-chaining technique is being implemented for collision handling,
          the time complexity increments from O(1) to O(n) compared to other collision handling techniques which can lead to bigger 
          execution times.
        +search: This method return a boolean indicating if there exists an object in the table that matches the given key. When it does,
        it returns true and false otherwise.
        Time complexity: O(n) in the worst case, being needed to travel and read all the elements.
        Space complexity: O(1) because the amount of space required to store temporal values is always the same.
        Tradeoffs:
          - Due to the reason that sometimes there could exist some key-value pairs that produces the same hash value, a linked
          list might be created in order to avoid the collision of those elements, and for that reason the time complexity increments
          from O(1) to O(n) being n the size of the chain that have to be traversed.
        +#rehashing:  Creates a new table, re make the hash value for every exiting element in the old table and insert all of them into
        the new one, discarding the old table.
        Time complexity: O(n) The more element the previous table has, the more time will be needed to reconvert the hashing for every of
        them. So it depends directly of the amount of key-value pairs existing.
        Space complexity: O(n) At one exact time, there are 2 variables referring to a collections, which are `copy`, `table`(the new table)
        which has the double of length than te old table. This amount of collections is constant and the space they require depends directly
        on the amount of elements and the length of the old table, which is n.
        Tradeoffs:
          - It requires some extra memory in a certain period when making copies of the current table in order to regenerate hashes and pass
          all elements from one to another collection.
