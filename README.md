# Usage
As seen, the language utilized is Typescript. (.ts files) For this reason it will be necessary to install Node.js and typescript in order to run the files'
content.

Once you've installed Node.js:
- you can run this script 'npm install-g typescript'
- you should navigate through your terminal to the location of the file desired to  run
- you should run this command 'tsc sol.ts' to compile the file
- and finally you should run 'node sol.js' command to execute the file
