# Requirements
it will be necessary to install Node.js and typescript in order to run the files' content.
- You should install Node.js -> https://nodejs.org/en/download

# Usage
- navigate through your terminal to the location of the desired 'main.js' file to run
- then you should run 'node main.js' command to execute the file

# Note
If there is no main.js file available it is surely because I could not integrate the task files's content in it. So I recommend to check the files within the tasks's folders!
