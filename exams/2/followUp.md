&nbsp;	-why to create a server passing a request and answer? 

&nbsp;	-http-example.js file: end() instruction can be put outside the if-else's brackets

 	-middleware with no path indicated (executes with every exectues with any type of http request)

 	-get()

 	-error middleware: use((err,req,res,next))

 	-benefits of middleware

 		= simplicity

 		= flexibility

 		= enhanced features
